# simple-currency-converter

Portfolio Project for ALXSE

This project is part of activities carried out during ALXSE course to demonstrate the
the skills gained during the course.

**Project Title:** CI/CD Pipeline of an Online Currency Converter

**Project Description:**

```
This project aims to develop an Online Currency Converter application using React for the frontend and Django Rest Framework for the backend. The application will provide real-time currency conversion rates and a user-friendly interface for seamless currency calculations.
```

```
To ensure a robust and efficient development process, we will implement a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This pipeline will automate the build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins, Docker, and GitHub. Jenkins will orchestrate the CI/CD pipeline, Docker will containerize the application for consistency across different environments, and GitHub will serve as the version control and collaboration platform.
```

```
The CI/CD pipeline will enhance the development workflow by enabling automated testing, reducing deployment times, and ensuring high-quality code is delivered consistently. This project demonstrates the integration of modern development tools and practices to streamline software delivery, making it a valuable addition to any software engineering portfolio.
